# ðŸŒ¾ Farming Sim

A 2D farming simulation game inspired by *Harvest Moon* and *Stardew Valley*, built in Godot Engine. This project is currently in development, with features like state-based character behavior, tool usage, and movement mechanics being implemented.

## ðŸšœ Features (In Progress)

- **State Machine System**  
  - Implemented using NodeStateMachine and NodeState classes.  
  - Handles transitions between character states (e.g., Idle, Walking, Chopping).  

- **Character Control & Animation**  
  - Directional movement based on input actions.  
  - Tool interactions (e.g., chopping, watering, planting).  

- **Modular & Scalable Design**  
  - More states and mechanics to be added in future updates.

- **Day-Night Cycle & Seasonal Changes**  
  - Day and Night cycle added
  - Debug control system to modify time
